## About

This is the repo we will be using for the course. Here you will code the solutions to the assignments. But remember you also have to turn the in using Aula Virtual.

From this moment on, you can edit this README as you like. But remember to keep the structure of the repo, otherwise your solutions will not be easily accesible.

This is my modification
